ASM Dropper
===========

This is a very simple dropper written in ASM using FASM, for MS Windows environments.

This example loads the resources such as libraries and API addresses at runtime by looking for
kernel32.dll base in the stack (I've another version using PEB to get the kernel32.dll base address
somewhere in my backups, but isn't too dificult to implement it).
